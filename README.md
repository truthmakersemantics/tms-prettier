This GitHub action can be used to apply [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to checked out code on a GitHub server as part of another action.

The action is completely based on the code of [creyD/prettier_action](https://github.com/creyD/prettier_action). The action by crayD is, in a sense, more powerful but it has some functionality hard-coded we don't want/need (viz. pushing the prettified code back to GitHub). Hence this action.

If you ended up here looking for a GitHub action to use in your project, you're probably better off with creyD's action.
